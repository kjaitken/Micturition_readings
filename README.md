### Micturition_readings
##Method to analyse micturition readings from a LoggerPro connected to weigh scales or other measurement device. 

This method will allow you to take something like this:

and turn it into useable data like this:

The data here available for trial here is 'dummy' data which can be replaced with your own. 
Adjust the threshold of detection and the small voids threshold according to the distribution in your species, strain and age. Additionally, use of this with mouse data requires additional filtering due to the presence of solid material. Additional python code will be placed on this site for mouse data, but the original for the mouse data is from Martin Sidler's publications and script:
